All files needed to build the project are in the "LDI_Assessment" folder. Five example files should be moved to the
bin\Debug\net6.0 folder (however, the files should already be there). Any new code file should also be added there. To open a file compile 
and run the project and type the [Filename].txt in the console to open it. The project requires the .NET 6.0 and Visual Studio v2022 to run.
